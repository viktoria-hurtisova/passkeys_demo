# Passkeys and WebAuthn Demo

This repo is for an assignment for subject **NSWI202 Bezpečnost softwarových systémů v praxi**. The main point of this assignment is to create a demo page where we can register and authenticate with Passkeys or WebAuthn.

Multiple things are not implemented due to not being necessary for this assignment. This is JUST a small demo. It is not supposed to be used in practice. You can use this code as a guide, but remember this is not meant for real applications.

When looking at the code, please remember that this is my first JavaScript application.

For more information, please read [the W3C Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/).
